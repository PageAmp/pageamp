_Logical attributes_ can be easily animated. Animations can be chained and different easing algorithms can be chosen for the start and the end of each segment.

As shown above, it's easy to coordinate the motion of distinct elements using a common animated attribute.

Note that even projects requiring visual animation may choose to only use CSS animations. For this reason algorithmic animation support will be optional in future releases in order to further reduce client code size.
