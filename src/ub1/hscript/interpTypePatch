// To be used with:
//      --macro patchTypes('src/ub1/react/interpTypePatch')
// in the build hxml file.
//
// It adds this metadata:
//      @:build(ub1.react.InterpPatch.patch())
// to the hscript.Interp class, so the InterpPatch build macro can change
// the type of `variables` in the class to `Dynamic`.
//
// This is needed because the original type was `Map<String,Dynamic>`,
// whose `get()` and `set()` methods are inlined. We want to use instances
// of ReScope as value of `variables`, and calls to its own `get()` and `set()`
// methods wouldn't work.

@:build(ub1.hscript.InterpPatch.patch()) hscript.Interp
